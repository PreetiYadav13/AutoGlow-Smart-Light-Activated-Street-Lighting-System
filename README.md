# AutoGlow-Smart-Light-Activated-Street-Lighting-System
This project showcases an automatic street lighting system using an LDR sensor and Arduino. It detects low light conditions to automatically switch on LEDs, saving energy by only illuminating when needed. The system adjusts in real-time based on ambient light, making it ideal for efficient and sustainable street lighting solutions.
